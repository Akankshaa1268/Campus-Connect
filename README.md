# Campus-Connect
<p> Campus Connect is my first ever ui/ux project made by me and my team members. Its a prototype of a website build using figma. </p>
<b> About the project: </b> 
To address the challenges of campus communication, 
A centralized platform campus connect is designed to streamline information across and enhance engagement.
By consolidating announcements, personalized notifications, and resources into one user-friendly interface, our platform aims to enhance communication and connection among students and faculty.
While many projects may aim to improve  campus communication, Campus Connect stands out due to its personalized features and advanced functionalities. Unlike other platforms like whatsApp, our solution tailors notifications and resources to individual students, ensuring they receive relevant information based on their specific courses and interests. 
Additionally, the platformâ€™s unique features, like detailed attendance tracking with visual analytics and a dedicated community section for connecting with peers and societies, enhance the overall experience.
